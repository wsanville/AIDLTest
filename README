The goal for this is to:
1) Deploy a service in one application, and use it from a differernt application using AIDL.
2) Bind and unbind to the service properly from the consumer app.
3) Support default config change behavior from the consumer app.
4) Don't block the UI thread in the consumer app (not done yet).
